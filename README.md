The main contribution of this project consists of analyzing the Sprott C and Thomas chaotic systems,
demonstrating the practical applicability of the two models in image encryption, the complete implementation
of the Vernam/Vigenère algorithm based on XOR and chaotic permutation, comparing performance in terms of entropy, statistical independence, pixel correlation in encrypted images, key autocorrelation, sensitivity, and resistance to cyber attacks.
